International education was worth \\$32.4 billion to the Australian economy in 2017â€“18.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The economy, international and domestic movements are expected to rebound as the pandemic finishes. This report explores the neighbourhoods in three popular Australian local government areas (LGA) and nine capital cities of selected countries and makes recommendations for tourists, international students and people who are going to move around in Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents the similarity and dissimilarity among the twelve areas by analysing venues in neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods are grouped into clusters based on venue categories by using K-means clustering algorithm."
