    "International and domestic travel movements and oversea students are significantly disrupted due to the outbreak of COVID-19. In February 2020, overseas visitor arrivals to Australia decreased 26% compared to the same month a year ago.  \n",

    "Tourism and international students in Australia are an important component of the Australian economy. Tourism consists of domestic and international components and the contribution was a record \\$44.6 billion in 2019. International education was worth \\$32.4 billion to the Australian economy in 2017â€“18.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The economy, international and domestic movements are expected to rebound as the pandemic finishes. This report explores the neighbourhoods in three popular Australian local government areas (LGA) and nine capital cities of selected countries and makes recommendations for tourists, international students and people who are going to move around in Australia. \n",

    "This report presents the similarity and dissimilarity among the twelve areas by analysing venues in neighbourhoods. Neighbourhoods are grouped into clusters based on venue categories by using K-means clustering algorithm."
